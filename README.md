# Java-Tutorial

Hello everyone. This is a small Java-Tutorial repository I made to refresh my java knowledge. I got help from [here](https://www.w3schools.com/java/default.asp) while preparing the content, and sometimes I even copied it directly where I got bored. No more sorry for that. This project has been created in order to be able to quickly find issues that I did not think of in the future and to see some useful examples that may be useful to other people who want help in this matter.

## Practice with Git-Github
